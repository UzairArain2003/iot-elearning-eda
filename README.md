📊 IoT Enhanced E-Learning Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IoT Enhanced E-learning Dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to analyze student engagement and attention patterns, compare learning modes, and identify behavioral insights that can help improve e-learning strategies.

🔹 Tasks Performed

✅ Checked dataset info, summary statistics, and missing values

✅ Value counts for categorical features (student_id, learning_mode)

✅ Daily average engagement and attention with line plots

✅ Identified Top 10 most engaged and Bottom 10 least engaged students

✅ Compared engagement across learning modes using bar charts

🔹 Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

Pandas (data cleaning & manipulation)

NumPy (numerical operations)

Matplotlib (data visualization)

🔹 Dataset

IoT Enhanced E-learning Dataset: Kaggle Link

🔹 Key Insights

📈 Daily engagement and attention show fluctuating but clear patterns

🧑‍🎓 Top students are far more engaged compared to bottom students

🎓 Learning mode strongly affects engagement (IoT-based/interactive modes higher)

🔎 Engagement and attention are positively correlated

📊 Performance gaps suggest scope for personalized learning approaches
